    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a results-oriented machine learning engineer with two years of experience building predictive models that drive public health impact. My background bridges data science and social care, with a focus on ethical AI, health equity, and automated insights. I specialize in deploying models and dashboards that inform real-world interventions—most recently improving clinic attendance by 12% through ML-triggered SMS reminders. I also bring consulting experience in using large language models and no-code platforms for automation.

    <h2>MSc in Data Science for Health and Social Care</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently completing my MSc at the University of Edinburgh. This program has equipped me with strong foundations in statistical modelling, machine learning, privacy-preserving data practices, and real-world health data workflows. I’ve applied these skills in practical settings, including survival analysis, mixed-methods research, and data visualization using tools like Quarto, Python, and R.

    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project 1: Generative-AI Health Portal</h3>
      <p>Used OpenAI API + GitHub Pages + no-code tools to automate health info queries. Boosted conversion rate to lab services by 30%.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project 2: Treatment Adherence Risk Model</h3>
      <p>Built a survival-forest model using pandas to predict non-adherence. Pilot results showed a 10% increase in medication compliance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project 3: Real-Time Outbreak Monitor</h3>
      <p>Processed 50,000+ clinical notes monthly using NLTK and Naïve Bayes to detect outbreak trends. Saved 70 staff hours/month.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project 4: Quarto Health Reports</h3>
      <p>Created automated R/Python Quarto reports, reducing report drafting time by 5 days.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project 5: Vaccine No-Show Predictor</h3>
      <p>Deployed a random forest model to flag likely missed appointments. Triggered SMS nudges and raised attendance by 12 percentage points.</p>
